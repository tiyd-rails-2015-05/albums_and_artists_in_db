# Albums and Artists in a Database

## Description

Modify an existing program (which stores, changes, and communicates information about albums and their artists) to persist this information in a database.

## Instructions

You've previously built an application to track albums and their artists.  The code to do this is present in this folder.  However, you're now in a situation where you'd like to keep this information around long-term.  It's time for a database.

Modify your existing code to store this information in a SQLite database.  Find your own way, padawan.
